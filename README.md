# Project Euler
> Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve.
\- https://projecteuler.net/

Each problem introduces a new concept, or builds on an existing concept. One of the goals is for all solutions to have a runtime of under 1 minute (although most are under 1 second), forcing optimized programming methods.

For convenience, the problem statement is at the top of each file, and solution notes (if applicable) are at the bottom.

## Run Locally

Clone the project:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:KGB33/Project-Euler.git
cd Project-Euler
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate && python -m pip install --upgrade pip'
pip install pyproject.toml
```

Run/Test the Problems:

```bash
./run_all_problems.py
```
