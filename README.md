# Project-Euler
###### _Solutions By Kelton Bassingthwaite_

Various coding challanges from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

Each problem introduces a new concept, or builds on an existing concept.
One of the goals is for all solutions to have a runtime of under 1 minute (although most are under 1 second), forcing optimized programming methods.

For convenience, the problem is at the top of each file, and solution notes (if applicable) are at the bottom.


## Noteable Problems

  * p028 - Number spiral diagonals
    - This problem has you find the sum of the numbers on the diagonals of a 1001x1001 square spiral.
  * p018/p067 - Maximum Path Sum I/II
    - These problems have you find the maximum sum on a binary tree with 15/100 rows. Creating the algorthum to effecently solve it was very rewarding.


## Tools
Some of these problems reqire the same operation. These can be found in PrimeTools.py and noteable ones include:

   * Sieve Of Eratosthenes
   * Prime Factors
   * timer decorator
