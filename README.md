###### _Solutions By Kelton Bassingthwaite_

Various Problems from https://projecteuler.net/

Each problem introduces a new concept, or builds on an existing concept. 
It must have a runtime under 1 minute (although most are under 1 second), forcing optimized programming methods. 

For convenience, the problem is at the top of each file, and solution notes (if applicable) are at the bottom.
