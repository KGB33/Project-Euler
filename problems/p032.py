# Pandigital products
# Problem 32
"""
    We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital
if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once;
for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

    The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity,

        39 Ã— 186 = 7254

    containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.


    Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product
identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.

    HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way
so be sure to only include it once in your sum.
