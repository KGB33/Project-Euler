Names scores
Problem 22
Using 'p022 - data.txt' a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names,

> begin by sorting it into alphabetical order.
> Then working out the alphabetical value for each name
        multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.


For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order,
COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list.
So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.

What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
