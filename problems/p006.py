"""# Sum Square Difference
### Problem 6

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural
numbers is,

    12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural
numbers is,

    (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the
squares of the first ten natural numbers and the
square of the sum is `3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640`.

Find the difference between the sum of the
squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and
the square of the sum.
